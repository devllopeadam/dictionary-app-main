## About The Project

Users should be able to:

1. Search for words using the input field
2. See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word
3. See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
4. Play the audio file for a word when it's available
5. Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
6. Switch between light and dark themes

I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel-perfect.
